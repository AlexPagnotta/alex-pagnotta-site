# Hi there!

This is your first markdown page. It probably isn't styled much, although
Markdown does support **bold** and _italics._

To learn more about adding a layout to your page,

A little over a month ago, the first public beta for Astro was released to the world. Since then, we have been fixing bugs and gathering your feedback on what to tackle next. Today, we are excited to announce the release of some of our most requested features.

We are excited to introduce Astro v0.18, featuring:

- **[Responsive partial hydration:](#responsive-partial-hydration)** Hydrate components with CSS media queries.
- **[Named slots:](#named-slots-in-astro-components)** Support multiple content entrypoints inside of Astro components.
- **[Solid.js support:](#solid-support)** Use [Solid.js](https://www.solidjs.com/) components in Astro.
- **[Lit support:](#solid-support)** Use [Lit SSR](https://lit.dev/) to get server-side rendering for web components.
- [`<style global>` support](https://docs.astro.build/guides/styling#overview), [GitHub syntax highlighting](https://twitter.com/n_moore/status/1417881860051509250) and a [shiny new docs site.](https://docs.astro.build/)
